# Credit-Risk-Modelling
I built a simple credit scoring model.

Throughout the project, I used several important data science techniques, such as:

- Weight of evidence

- Information value

- Fine classing

- Coarse classing

- Linear regression

- Logistic regression

- Area Under the Curve

- Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve

- Gini Coefficient

- Kolmogorov-Smirnov

- Assessing Population Stability

- Maintaining a model
